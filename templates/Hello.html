        <h1>Konrad</h1>
        <div><font size=5>
        Konrad is a single column model of the tropical atmosphere, from the
        surface upwards through the atmosphere.
        This kind of model is a 1D Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE) model,
        because the main processes involved are
            <abbr title="the reflection, absorption, transmission and scattering of light">radiative transfer</abbr>
        and
            <abbr title="the rising motion of warm low density air over colder denser air">convection</abbr>.
        Convection occurs in
            <abbr title="the lowest part of the atmosphere, where temperature decreases with height">the troposphere</abbr>,
        and causes cloud formation.
        In konrad, convection takes heat energy from the surface and brings it
        up into the troposphere, but it does not model cloud formation.
        Many real world processes are missing from konrad, including winds and
        heat transport from the tropics to mid or high
            <abbr title="Latitude is an angle describing closeness to the equator. The tropics are at low latitudes, and the polar regions are at high latitudes.">latitudes</abbr>.
        Despite this, we can still learn some
        interesting things about the real tropical atmosphere.</font></div>

            For a certain set of input parameters (the amounts of various gases,
            an initial temperature profile, surface properties, the amount of
            incoming solar radiation), we use a radiative transfer scheme
            to calculate radiative heating rates.
            These are applied to the input temperature profile, producing a
            new temperature profile.
            If the new temperature profile is unstable to convection, a
            convective adjustment is applied.
            This changes the temperature profile again, giving us another new
            temperature profile.
            Then we calculate changes in other atmospheric properties, such as
            the water vapour concentration.
            The new set of parameters is used as input to the radiative
            transfer scheme and the whole process is repeated many times.
            Eventually, the change to the temperature profile becomes very
            small, and we say that the system has reached equilibrium.
            It could take thousands of years for the real Earth system to get
            to equilibrium.
