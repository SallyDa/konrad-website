            To learn about atmospheric processes and how they influence
            temperature, we can use climate models.
            Konrad is a single column model of the
            <abbr title="near the equator" tabindex="-1">tropical</abbr> atmosphere, from the
            surface upwards through the atmosphere.
            This kind of model is a 1D Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE) model,
            because the main processes involved are
            <button class="collapsible">radiative transfer</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In models of the atmosphere, radiative transfer describes how light from the Sun and heat from the Earth travel through and interact with the atmosphere.</p>

            and
            <abbr title="the rising motion of warm low density air over colder denser air" tabindex="-1">convection</abbr>.
            Many real world processes are missing from konrad, including
            cloud formation, winds and heat transport from the tropics to mid or high
            <abbr title="Latitude is an angle describing closeness to the equator. The tropics are at low latitudes, and the polar regions are at high latitudes." tabindex="-1">latitudes</abbr>.
            Despite this, we can still use konrad to learn some interesting
            things about the tropical atmosphere. For example, we can study
            how the temperature depends on different gases,
            <abbr title="power per unit area of radiation received from the Sun" tabindex="-1">solar irradiance</abbr>,
            the strength of convection, and the properties of clouds.
            </font></div>
        <br />
        <div><font size=4>
            For a certain set of input parameters (the amounts of various gases,
            an initial temperature profile, surface properties, the amount of
            incoming solar radiation), we use a radiative transfer scheme
            to calculate radiative heating rates.
            These are applied to the input temperature profile, producing a
            new temperature profile.
            If the new temperature profile is unstable to convection, a
            convective adjustment is applied in
            <abbr title="the lowest part of the atmosphere, where temperature decreases with height" tabindex="-1">the troposphere</abbr>.
            This changes the temperature profile again, giving us another new
            temperature profile.
            Then we calculate changes in other atmospheric properties, such as
            the water vapour concentration.
            The new set of parameters is used as input to the radiative
            transfer scheme and the whole process is repeated many times.
            Eventually, the change to the temperature profile becomes very
            small, and we say that the system has reached equilibrium.

        the development of which started in the 1990s, and the scheme
        continues to be used in many weather prediction and climate models.
