        Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have been
        increasing strongly since
        <abbr title="In climate science, 'pre-industrial' normally refers to the atmospheric state of 1850. The industrial revolution started about a hundred years before this in Britain, and it brought about many technological advancements. Initially its impact on the environment was small, but this grew over time and as industrialisation spread to other parts of the world.">pre-industrial times</abbr>,
        when there were about 280
        <abbr title="parts per million by volume">ppmv</abbr>.
        CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas, which means that it absorbs and
        emits
        <abbr title="In climate science, longwave radiation describes the radiation emitted from the surface and the atmosphere, a lot of which is infrared.">longwave radiation</abbr>.
        This stops some of the radiation from escaping to space and causes the
        surface and troposphere to warm.

    <div>
        Water vapour is also a greenhouse gas, and as the
        atmosphere warms, it is expected that the amount of water vapour in the
        air will increase such that the
        <abbr title="The relative humidity is a fraction of the saturation humidity, where the saturation humidity is the maximum amount of water vapour that the air can contain.">relative humidity</abbr>
        remains constant.
