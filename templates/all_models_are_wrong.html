    <h1>Model approximations</h1>

    <div>
        Models are approximations of real systems.
        By definition, they are not reality, but if they include good
        descriptions of the most important parts of the system, they can be
        useful.

        Konrad contains lots of approximations.
        One assumption we make is that there are no clouds.
        Clouds and changes in clouds can affect the atmospheric temperature
        profile and how the atmosphere reacts to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> or
        other factors.

        The
        <abbr title="A radiative transfer scheme is a model that calculates how
        much of the incoming radiation is reflected, absorbed,
	    scattered and transmitted by the model's atmosphere.
	    It also calculates how much radiation is emitted by the surface and
	    atmosphere and how much of this is absorbed or transmitted as it makes
	    its way upwards to space."
              tabindex="-1">radiative transfer scheme</abbr>
        in konrad also contains many approximations.
        It was designed for the current climate of Earth.
        When we remove all of the ozone in konrad, this drastically changes
        the temperature profile and under these conditions the radiation scheme
        has large errors.

        Konrad only models the
        <abbr title="near the equator" tabindex="-1">tropical</abbr>
        atmosphere and does not include heat transport from the tropics to mid
        or high
        <abbr title="Latitude is an angle describing closeness to the equator.
        The tropics are at low latitudes, and the polar regions are at high
        latitudes." tabindex="-1">latitudes</abbr>.
        Instead, so that the atmosphere in konrad does not get too hot, we
        reduce the amount of incoming solar radiation.
        In this way, we assume that all the heat transport occurs in the
        atmosphere, while in reality some of the heat is transported by ocean
        currents.

    <div>
        Konrad contains information about the amounts of different gasses
        contained in the atmosphere.
        The three most important gases seen by the radiation are water vapour,
        CO<sub>2</sub> and ozone.
        CO<sub>2</sub> is well-mixed, which means that the concentration is
        almost constant throughout the whole atmosphere.
        The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is well-known, because it is
        measured throughout the world.
        The ozone profile is also well-known, so the assumptions about
        CO<sub>2</sub> and ozone are good.
        On the other hand, water vapour amounts vary throughout the
        <abbr title="the area near the equator" tabindex="-1">tropics</abbr> and
        with the time of day, as water at the surface
        <abbr title="changes from liquid to gas" tabindex="-1">evaporates</abbr>
        and water vapour in the atmosphere
        <abbr title="changes from gas to liquid" tabindex="-1">condenses</abbr>
        and it rains.
        These processes are not included in konrad, where we assume that one
        profile of water vapour represents the whole of the tropics.
