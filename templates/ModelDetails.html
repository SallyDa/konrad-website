        For a certain set of input parameters (the amounts of various gases,
        an initial temperature profile, surface properties, the amount of
        incoming solar radiation), we use a radiative transfer scheme
        to calculate radiative heating rates.
        These are applied to the input temperature profile, producing a
        new temperature profile.
        If the new temperature profile is unstable to convection, a
        convective adjustment is applied in
        <abbr title="the lowest part of the atmosphere, where temperature decreases with height" tabindex="-1">the troposphere</abbr>.
        This changes the temperature profile again, giving us another new
        temperature profile.
        Then we calculate changes in other atmospheric properties, such as
        the water vapour concentration.
        The new set of parameters is used as input to the radiative
        transfer scheme and the whole process is repeated many times.
        Eventually, the change to the temperature profile becomes very
        small, and we say that the system has reached equilibrium.

        the development of which started in the 1990s, and the scheme
        continues to be used in many weather prediction and climate models.
