    <h1>Model parts</h1>
    <div>Konrad is split into several model components, each of which
        has a specific purpose and all of which work together.
        <ul type="disk">
            <li><strong>atmosphere</strong> &mdash; contains different gasses
                and the temperature profile</li>
            <li><strong>surface</strong> &mdash; with a
                <abbr title="The surface temperature determines how much
                radiation the surface emits." tabindex="-1">temperature</abbr>,
                <abbr title="The surface reflectivity tells the radiation scheme
                how much radiation the surface reflects."
                      tabindex="=1">reflectivity</abbr> and
                <abbr title="The heat capacity determines how quickly the
                surface warms or cools." tabindex="-1">heat capacity</abbr>
            </li>
            <li><strong>radiative transfer scheme</strong>
                <br /> &emsp; &mdash; needs information about sunlight, the
                surface and the atmosphere
                <br /> &emsp; &mdash; calculates how much radiation is
                reflected, scattered, absorbed, emitted and transmitted by the
                atmosphere and surface
            </li>
            <li><strong>convective adjustment</strong> &mdash; prevents
                atmospheric temperature decreasing too quickly with height</li>
            <li><strong>lapse rate</strong> &mdash; tells the convective
                adjustment how quickly temperatures should decrease with
                height</li>
            <li><strong>humidity model</strong> &mdash; tells the atmosphere
                how much water vapour it contains</li>
        </ul>
        The different components are put together in the model core, which
        keeps track of time in the model.

    <h1>How the model runs</h1>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='model-flow.png') }}" align="left"
         alt="This sentence should be a diagram of the model flow."
         style="width:272px;height:657px;">
    <div>
        For a certain set of
        <abbr title="data that is fed to the model" tabindex="-1">input
            parameters</abbr>
        (the amounts of various gases, an initial temperature profile, surface
        properties, the amount of incoming solar radiation), we use a
        <abbr title="A radiative transfer scheme is a model that calculates how
        much of the incoming radiation is reflected, absorbed, scattered and
        transmitted by the model's atmosphere.
	    It also calculates how much radiation is emitted by the surface and
	    atmosphere and how much of this is absorbed or transmitted as it makes
	    its way upwards to space."
              tabindex="-1">radiative transfer scheme</abbr>
        to calculate
        <abbr title="As molecules absorb radiation, they gain energy and the
        atmosphere warms. On the other hand, if the molecules emit radiation,
        they lose energy and the atmosphere cools. The heating rate describes
        how quickly the atmosphere warms or cools." tabindex="-1">radiative
            heating rates</abbr>.
        We add the change in temperature to the input temperature profile,
        producing a new temperature profile.
        If the new temperature profile is
        <abbr title="A temperature profile is unstable to convection if the
        temperature of the surface or lowest layers of the atmosphere is much
        larger than the temperatures above. When this happens in the real
        atmosphere, the warm air below rises over the cold dense air above."
              tabindex="-1">unstable to convection</abbr>, a
        <abbr title="In konrad, we do not have motion of air. Instead our
        convective adjustment just changes the temperature of the surface and
        atmosphere. The temperature change we apply is similar to that which
        occurs through motion of air in convection in the real world."
              tabindex="-1">convective adjustment</abbr>
        is applied in the
        <abbr title="the lowest part of the atmosphere, where temperature
        decreases with height" tabindex="-1">troposphere</abbr>.
        This changes the temperature profile again, giving us another new
        temperature profile.
        Then we calculate changes in other atmospheric properties, such as
        the water vapour concentration, which depends on the temperature.
        The new set of parameters is used as input to the radiative
        transfer scheme and the whole process is repeated many times.
        Eventually, the
        <abbr title="the change due to radiation plus the change due to
        convection" tabindex="-1">total change</abbr> to the temperature
        profile becomes very small, and we say that the system has reached
        equilibrium.

        Konrad is written in
            <a href='https://www.python.org/' target='_blank'>python</a>
        and is available on
            <a href='https://github.com/atmtools/konrad' target='_blank'>our github page</a>
        for anyone to download and use.
        The radiative transfer scheme used in konrad is
            <a href='http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html' target='_blank'>RRTMG</a>,
        the development of which started in the 1990s, and the scheme
        continues to be used in many weather prediction and climate models.
            <a href='http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html' target='_blank'>RRTMG</a>
        is written in fortran and made accessible through python by
