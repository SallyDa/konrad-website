    <h1>The developers of konrad</h1>
    <div><font size=5>
        We are PhD students, which means we get paid to study and do research,
        and one day we will be able to call ourselves doctors, even though we
        won't be qualified to help sick people.

    <h2>Our research</h2>
    <div><font size=5>
        We use konrad to study the climate and how it depends on different
        things.
